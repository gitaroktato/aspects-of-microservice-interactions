# Aspects of Microservice Interactions
What are the recent challenges of microservice interactions? Have you ever had any issues with service-to-service calls which were especially hard to manage? Were you wondering about the reasons?
Unfortunately, there are some rules we can not bend. For instance, we can't modify the laws of physics and statistics. But luckily some problems are easily solvable. 

In this presentation I will look at the different aspects of microservice interactions and compare the most popular technologies available, so you can pick the most favorable one for your specific use case.
