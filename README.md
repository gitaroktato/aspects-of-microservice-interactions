# Aspects of Microservice Interactions

What are the recent challenges of microservice interactions? Have you ever had issues with service-to-service calls that were particularly challenging to manage? Were you wondering about the reasons? Unfortunately, there are some rules we cannot bend. For instance, we can't modify the laws of physics and statistics. But luckily some problems are easily solved.


In this presentation, I will look at the different aspects of microservice interactions and show some practical problems & solutions I faced. In this way, you can stand your ground better in similar situations.
