Optimizing Microservice Interactions by Principles

What are the typical challenges of microservice interactions at scale? Have you ever had issues with service-to-service calls that were particularly challenging to handle? Were you wondering about the reasons? Unfortunately, there are some theoretical rules we can't bypass. For instance, we can't modify the laws of physics and statistics. But luckily some problems are easily solved:

Trough this workshop, we will look at the different aspects of microservice interactions and I'll show you some practical use-cases I faced. In the end we'll optimize a specific scenario step-by-step.
